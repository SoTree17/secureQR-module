## How to SecureQR Works?
![howtowork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48395704/137630194-610db5c1-fffc-44ee-b37c-f7b2d4bc0ea3.gif)
1. Scan the QR code (generated by the server using secureQR-module) in the mobile app.
2. Data and other information are sent to the server by secureQR-module-android.
3. The server decrypts the data and certifies that it is valid.
4. If decryption and authentication are successful, the original data is sent back to the mobile app


## Usage
### crypto
 > <b>Interface SecureQrCrypto</b>  
By implementing the SecureQrCrypto interface, you can use custom cryptographic objects with secureQR.

|Type|Method|Description|  
|----|------|-----------|
|String|getInstanceType()|Returns the type of the current instance as a string. If it is a cryptographic object, it returns "CRYPTO".|
|String|getMethodType()|Returns the encryption method as a string.|
|String|encrypt(String message)|Returns a string encrypted message.|
|String|decrypt(String message)|Returns a string that decrypts the message.|
<br>

 > <b>Interface SecureQrHash</b>      
 By implementing the SecureQrHash interface, you can use custom hash functions with secureQR.  
 
  |Type|Method|Description|  
|----|------|-----------|
|String|getInstanceType()|Returns the type of the current instance as a string. If it is a hash object, it returns "Hash".|
|String|getMethodType()|Returns the hash function method as a string.|
|String|hashing(String message)|Returns hashed message.|
<br>

### qr_util
> <b>class MethodPair</b>    
A pair of hash objects and cryptographic objects.  
 
 |Type|Method|Description|  
|----|------|-----------|
|Constructor|MethodPair(SecureQrHash _h, SecureQrCrypto _c)|Initialize MethodPair with parameters.|
|SecureQrCrypto|getCrypto()|Returns the stored cryptographic object.|
|SecureQrHash|getHash()|Returnsthe stored hash object.|

<br>

 > <b>class RandomString</b>       
A class that generates a random string.

|Type|Method|Description|  
|----|------|-----------|
|String|getString(int length)|Returns a random string of arbitrary length.|
